# Full python-model to tfjs-node

This is an example project to show how you can:

- Train a simple model with python (doc-classification with imdb-reviews)
- Save the model
- Load the model with tfjs-node to use it in a node-backend

## Setup

- Python 3.10
- Node 18.16.1 (18.17 does throw errors)
- g++/gdb (Linux) or C++ Build Tools (Windows)

Feel free to run the [cpp.main](./cpp-test/main.cpp) file to check if C++ is correctly configured.
